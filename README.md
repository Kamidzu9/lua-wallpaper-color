# lua-wallpaper-color

A small project written in Lua using the [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/) framework, inspired by [dylanaraps/pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). The goal is to generate a color palette from a wallpaper and create a color scheme, primarily as a way to learn Lua and LOVE2D.

**Status:** This project is in its early stages and is mainly for educational purposes.
